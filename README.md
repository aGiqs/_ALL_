# All

Hi, welcome to externals

Repositories for web development.

This is all to know: several repositories ready to use for big applications with feature externals.
Wich means:

Your app grows but new apps need newer versions of externals. This can be an anwer for you.

For each repo exists an "packages"" branch you may checkout to have several versions available.

# Install
The bundle you can find here in .gitmodule as list of submodules to be installed/downloaded.
Copy the submudules you want or get all repos and the "package"" branches as follow:

    git clone https://github.com/externals/all externals/
    cd externals/
    git submodule update --init
    git submodule update --remote

If your version is not included send a pull request or do it localy at you own.

This repos should solve problems for the future to be still active with new features and keep old stuff with old versions. ~10-15 Years of version changes i try to keep up before dropping them in packages branch.

Happy coding
