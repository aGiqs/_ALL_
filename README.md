Hi, welcome to externals

Repositories for web development.

This is all to know: several repositories ready to use for big applications with feature externals. wich means:

Your app grows but new apps need newer versions of externals. This can be an anwer for you.

For each repo there exists an packages branch you may checkout.

If your version is not included send a pull request or do it localy at you own.

This repos should solve problems for the future to be still active with new features and keep old stuff with old versions. ~10-15 Years of version changes i try to keep up before dropping them in packages branch.

Why this?
Really: Time should change things. CDN is not the anwser anymore and a trojan for your visitors! Host your stuff by your self!
Trust is good, controll is better!

Have a nice day :)
